# Meow-Meow-Go (Unity game engine and C#)
This is a 3D endless runner game developed using Unity and C#. In the game player will select and control one of the four cat characters and make movement (move left, move right, and jump) in order to collect coins and avoid collision with obstacles. The player will also be able to cast special spell (heal, shield, super jump and double coin score). The difficulty of the game will be leveled up by increasing the moving speed after the player collecting certain amount of coins. This project involves two people.

The script part (code in C#) can be found under Assets/Scripts.

Screen shots and video records can be found in Display file.
